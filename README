SYNOPSIS
	using libravatarsharp;
	var uri = AvatarUri.FromEmail( "someone@example.com" );
	var uri = AvatarUri.FromEmail( "someone@example.com", 
		new AvatarOptions { ... 

DESCRIPTION
	Libravatar-sharp is a very simple library for producing 
	libravatar URIs from user information, in a C# application.

OPTIONS
	AvatarOptions supports the following options:
	  * PreferHTTPS: Produce https:// URIs where possible,
		which is useful if including URIs in a page served via HTTPS.
		The default value is false.
	  * UseSHA256: Use the stronger SHA256 algorithm to hash the
		email address. This is harder to reverse, but breaks
		the fallback to Gravatar for missing images.
		The default value is false.
	  * DefaultImage: A URI to an image to use if none is found, or one
		of the values in AvatarDefaultImages. Not all servers support
		all of the magic values, however.
		The default value is null.
	  * Size: The size of the image you want, in pixels. Valid values are
		between 1 and 512 pixels inclusive.
		The default value is 80 pixels.

BUGS
	The following would be nice, but are not yet supported:

	  * OpenID lookups
	  * Federation via DNS SRV requests
